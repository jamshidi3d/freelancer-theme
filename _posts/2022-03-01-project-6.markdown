title: Physics-Based Rigging (Physirig)
video: physirig.mp4
description: <div align="left">Physirig is a physics-based rigging system made using Nvidia-PhysX. It is the project that I'm currently working on. Physirig works for any custom rigs and provides collision detection, physical constraints, physics-based posing and communication across characters and world. It would be extremely useful for animating multicharacter scenes(specially fighting scenes), animating complex character-object scenarios. Physirig also makes a huge impact on mechanical riggings; makes them precise, fast and robust.<br><br>
Currently, Physirig would be just available for blender but I'm planning to make the same structure for Maya.</div>
