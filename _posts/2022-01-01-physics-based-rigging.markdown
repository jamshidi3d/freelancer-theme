title: Physics-Based Rigging (Physirig)
video: physirig.mp4
description: <div align="left">It was natural for me to work on physics-based rigging after developing some cases of geometry-based rigging!<br><br>Physirig is a physics-based rigging system made using Nvidia-PhysX. (It is the project that I'm currently working on.) Physirig works for any custom rig and provides collision detection, physical constraints, physics-based posing, and physical communication across characters and world objects. It would be extremely useful for animating multicharacter scenes(especially fighting scenes), animating complex character-object scenarios. Physirig also makes a huge impact on mechanical riggings; makes them precise, fast, and robust.<br><br>Currently, Physirig would be just available in blender but I'm planning to make the same structure for Maya.</div>
