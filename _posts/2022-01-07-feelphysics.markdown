title: Interactive Physics Simulations(FeelPhysics)
video: 
description: <div align="left">For years, one of my main interests was bringing physics into life through simulations. I've done a wide range of simulations from planetary motions and relativistic phenomena to small mechanical systems. Most of times I develop my own physics from scratch because of simple nature of one single phenomenon that makes calculations faster. This interest in simulations has resulted to the idea of FeelPhysics. FeelPhysics is an educational game which consists of a set of fully interactive physics experiments. In above video you can see a spring simulation(done from scratch) that runs on a single cpu-core and can simulate transverse, longitudinal and circular waves.</div>
