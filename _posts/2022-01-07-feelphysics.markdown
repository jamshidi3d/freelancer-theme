title: Physics Simulations
video: physics_simulations.mp4
description: <div align="left">For years, one of my main interests was bringing physics equations into life through simulations, so I did a wide range of simulations from planetary motions and relativistic phenomena to small mechanical systems. Most of times I develop my own physics from scratch because of simple nature that usually one single phenomenon has and it makes calculations faster. This interest in physics simulations has resulted to the idea of FeelPhysics. FeelPhysics is an educational game which consists of a set of fully interactive experiments. For example in the above video you see a spring simulation(done from scratch) that runs on a single cpu-core in 100-fps(and above) and can simulate transverse, longitudinal and circular waves. Here player can also maniplate mass, stiffness, damping and gravity. There are lots of other interesting simulations that are not included in this video.</div>
