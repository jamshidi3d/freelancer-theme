description: <div align="left">Sometimes one can save years by bringing gpu in use! <br>This collection of shrink-wrapping / heat flow / burning features was necessary to simulate the real effect of flame on cable in the "Cable Termination VR" project. The sphere in the above video shows the flame effect range. Time dependence of surface temperature is implemented here and is modifiable. This time dependence is in a way that if the flame is far from the cable's surface, the temperature starts to decrease over time and the speed of decreasing is modifiable.</div>
