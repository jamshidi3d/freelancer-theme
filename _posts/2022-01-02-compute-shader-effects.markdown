description: <div align="left">Some times one can save years by bringing gpu in use! <br>This collection of shrink wrapping - heat flow - burning features were neccessary to simulate the real effect of flame on cable in "Cable Termination VR" project. Time dependence of surface temperature is also implemented here and is modifiable. This time dependence is in a way that if the flame is far from the cable's surface, the temperature starts to decrease by time and the speed of decreasing is modifiable.</div>
