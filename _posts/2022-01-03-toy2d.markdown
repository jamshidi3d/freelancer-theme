description: <div align="left">Toy2d (Hajmineh) is a set of interesting cardboard-craft kits together with how-to animations and AR-interactions. Toy2d addon/plugin helps designers to create unwrapped patterns of 3d models. It automatically makes animations in different manners, shows mesh-cut defects(places that are not able to unwrap with current cutting), shows different parts and allows designers to manipulate glue places. This tool is developed for both Blender and 3dsMax.</div>
