about1: I'm a Ph.D. student of physics working on gravitation & cosmology. In 2012 I started my career in the game industry with modeling in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353990/Parvaneh_Legacy_of_the_Lights_Guardians/" style="color:#FFFFFF">Parvaneh</a> project. Very soon in the same project, because of my background in math & physics and interest in technical arts, I started tool development and making physics-based assets. Since then I've done rigging and tool/shader development in Blender, Maya, 3dsMax, and also in Unity engine.

about2: In the academic field I gradually headed to computational physics, which was a good context for upgrading both my scientific and game-production skills (ofcourse, I love all areas in physics). Currently, together with research in cosmology (my old dream), I'm working on physics-based tools to help tech-artists & animators.
